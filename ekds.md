So yeah, I will probably see what to do here, one day.
Anyways, an example of how leaderboards will be displayed is:

| Rank | Player | Country | Time | Date |
| - | --------------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 1 | Towa | Japan | 1:11:303 | 2020-09-02 |
| 2 | Utterrandomness | UK | 1:11:983 | 2020-08-07 |
| 3 | MKDS1992 | Germany | 1:12:297 | 2020-07-23 |
| 4 | Pikalex04 | Italy | 1:14:275 | 2020-07-25 |
| 5 | Jake0214 | USA | 1:23:169 | 2020-07-23 |
| 6 | ThanksDude | Unknown | 1:43:028 | 2021-02-15 |

I still don't know if it's possible, but I will try to provide filters, AF scores, and individual players' pages.
I will see what I can do in my free time, I guess.
